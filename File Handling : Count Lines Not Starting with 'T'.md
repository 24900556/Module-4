# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
      with open('story.txt', 'w') as file:
          file.write("This is the first line.\n")
          file.write("Another line starts here.\n")
          file.write("Thatâ€™s yet another line.\n")
          file.write("One more line not starting with T.\n")
      
      with open('story.txt', 'r') as file:
          count = 0  
          for line in file:
              if not line.lstrip().startswith('T'):
                  count += 1  
      
      print("Number of lines that do not start with 'T':", count)
